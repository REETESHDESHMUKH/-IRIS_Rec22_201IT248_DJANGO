this repository contains task given to me for iris web team recruitment

## installation process :
run command :  python -m pip install django

## steps to run project :
1. u have to set terminal path as something like 'C:\New folder\myproj\webteam>' and run command 'python manage.py runserver'
2. then type this url 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/myforms/' as i made it as app so that it can be used in any other project as well.
3. all navigations are crystal clear u have to register using username , email and password otherwise login using same.
4. 'statistics' section will show forms u created and responses u made , u can view them by just one click.
5. to fill form it will ask form id which u got after creating form or else u can also using link u got.

## functionalities implemented :
* user authentication
* only authorised user will be allowed to create or fill form
* user can see all forms and responses he made 
* user can add different types of questions and once form is created , they will get one link along with form id using which anyone can fill that form.
* he can add different type of questions like single correct / multiple correct or text type.

## functionalities couldnt implemented :
* update the form which is already made and implementing dbms ( could be done if i mi8 have some more time.)
* better designing could be done but due to time constraint i couldnt
